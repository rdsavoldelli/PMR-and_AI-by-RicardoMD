# How AI-Based Digital Rehabilitation Improves Patient Adherence

This rapid review, published in *JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies* (2025), explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance patient adherence to rehabilitation programs — a critical factor in long-term recovery and functional outcomes.

## 🧠 Why adherence matters in rehabilitation

Adherence to rehabilitation regimens is often compromised by barriers such as distance, cost, lack of motivation, and limited access to clinical facilities. AI-based digital rehabilitation (DR) tools offer scalable solutions to these challenges by:

- Personalizing treatment plans  
- Tracking patient engagement  
- Sending motivational content and reminders  
- Facilitating communication between patients and providers  
- Objectively measuring adherence using wearable sensors and machine learning

## 📚 Key Findings from the Review

The review analyzed 6 studies and identified **6 mechanisms** by which AI improves adherence:

1. **Motivation and engagement**  
   - Exercise tracking, gamification, and personalized feedback  
2. **Improved communication**  
   - AI tools enhance provider-patient interaction  
3. **Personalized interventions**  
   - Tailored to cognitive style, readiness, and motivational drivers  
4. **Ease of use and accessibility**  
   - Mobile apps and wearables designed for usability  
5. **Automated reminders and alerts**  
   - Daily notifications to reinforce routines  
6. **Objective measurement of adherence**  
   - Sensor-based tracking vs. subjective self-reports

## 🔍 Clinical Relevance

AI-powered rehabilitation systems can:

- Reduce dropout rates  
- Increase home exercise performance  
- Improve functional outcomes and quality of life  
- Enable remote monitoring and real-time feedback  
- Support multidisciplinary care in resource-limited settings

## 💡 Reflection

This review reinforces the idea that AI is not just a technological upgrade — it's a strategic tool to **humanize and personalize rehabilitation**. By addressing the behavioral and logistical barriers to adherence, AI can help patients stay engaged, motivated, and supported throughout their recovery journey.
