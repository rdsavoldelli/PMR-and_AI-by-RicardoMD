# Artificial Intelligence in Neurorehabilitation: The Future Is Already Here

Neurorehabilitation has always been a complex and emotionally demanding field. Patients recovering from stroke, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases face long, multidisciplinary journeys — often marked by uncertainty and isolation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to reshape this landscape, not as a distant promise, but as a practical reality.

## 🧠 What is AI in rehabilitation?

AI in rehabilitation refers to the use of algorithms, language models, sensors, and conversational agents to:

- Support patients remotely  
- Improve treatment adherence  
- Predict clinical risks (like rehospitalization)  
- Educate patients and caregivers  
- Assist multidisciplinary teams in decision-making

## 🔍 What does this mean for us, as physicians?

- We can use AI to **extend our clinical presence**, even between appointments.  
- Conversational agents can **educate, guide, and comfort** patients in real time.  
- AI doesn’t replace the physician — **it amplifies our care**.

## 💡 Personal Reflection

As a physiatrist, I see AI as a powerful ally in humanizing care. A well-designed agent can be the voice that guides a patient at midnight, the video that teaches a caregiver how to perform safe catheterization, or the alert that prevents a rehospitalization.

The future of rehabilitation is digital, personalized, and guided by artificial intelligence — and physicians must lead this transformation.
