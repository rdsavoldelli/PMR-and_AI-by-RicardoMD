# Research and project ideas: digital biomarkers in rehabilitation

This document collects ideas, questions, and potential projects at the intersection of:

- Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine
- Biomechanics and gait analysis
- Digital biomarkers
- Artificial Intelligence

## 1. Falls in older adults

- Which gait features are most predictive of future falls?
- How can we integrate home-based wearables and in-clinic assessments?
- Clinical question:
  - Can we move from "retrospective fall history" to "prospective fall risk" using digital biomarkers?

## 2. Post-ICU and post-COVID trajectories

- Use wearable-derived activity and gait metrics to:
  - Track recovery
  - Identify patients at risk for persistent functional limitations
- Explore how AI can cluster different recovery phenotypes.

## 3. Elite athletes and return-to-sport

- Combine movement data with training load and subjective wellness.
- Use asymmetry and variability as digital biomarkers of:
  - Readiness
  - Overuse
  - Risk of re-injury

## 4. Clinical translation and education

- Create educational material for:
  - Physiatrists
  - Physical therapists
  - Sports medicine professionals
- Focus:
  - How to interpret digital biomarkers
  - How to ask clinically meaningful questions for data scientists

This roadmap is part of my ongoing work as a bridge-builder between **Rehabilitation Medicine, Biomechanics, and AI**.
